## Next steps for analysis

1. Double check image preprocesing -- bria
2. Double check data structures / extra metadata for dataset (sharon)
3. Decide on timepoints and how we're collapsing them
4. Sanity check whether we can do classificaitons on small dataset
5. Think about ways to quantify individual variability in classifications
